**Outputs Random Values**

You Can Change The Settings In The Settings.json<br><br>
*Note: The Graph's Size Is The Screen Size, You Can Also Configure These In The "container" variable*

In The Json File You May See TPS and steps, the tps stands for Tick Per Second but in milliseconds, this updates the graph. The steps is where the Pointer(The Red Line) has to move.
